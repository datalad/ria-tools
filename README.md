# RIA-Tools

This is supposed to become a collection of scripts to setup and maintain a
datalad RIA store. For now this is not intended to be an installable package,
since generic deployment and acceptable dependencies aren't obvious. Instead
it's an entry point showing what you can (and may be have to) do and how.
